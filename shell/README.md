# Advanced Bash-Scripting Guide

<!--
https://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/index.html
-->

This tutorial assumes no previous knowledge of scripting or programming, yet progresses 
rapidly toward an intermediate/advanced level of instruction . . . all the while sneaking 
in little nuggets of UNIXÂ® wisdom and lore. It serves as a textbook, a manual for 
self-study, and as a reference and source of knowledge on shell scripting techniques. 
The exercises and heavily-commented examples invite active reader participation, under 
the premise that the only way to really learn scripting is to write scripts.
